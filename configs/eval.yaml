# - "resnet50"
# - "vit_base_patch16_224"

# Evaluation source
# Option A) Lightning checkpoint produced by Trainer (recommended)
checkpoint_path: mlruns/532985920235893590/27d7f552e0af4f2fa206d9e9a05fa0a1/checkpoints/resnet50-epoch=00-val_loss=0.0179.ckpt

# Option B) Evaluate a "fresh" model with random or pretrained weights (for sanity checks)
# If checkpoint_path is null, the script will evaluate the instantiated model as-is.
